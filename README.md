This project delves into an in-depth analysis of furniture sales data, aiming to uncover seasonal patterns and trends. By employing time series analysis, the study reveals a distinct seasonal trend, with an off-season observed early in the year and a subsequent linear increase in sales. The ultimate goal is to provide valuable insights that inform strategic decision-making for a retail superstore, optimizing sales strategies and enhancing inventory management practices. The project's steps include cloning the repository, navigating to the project directory, and installing necessary dependencies. Following the provided Jupyter notebook, users can conduct the analysis, extract actionable insights, and apply them to refine their retail strategies. Contributions to enhance the project are welcomed, with detailed guidelines available in the contributing documentation
